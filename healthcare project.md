## Data Source
The healthcare dashboard was developed for Axia Africa, leveraging data provided by Axia Africa. The dataset contains 15 columns and 2000 rows, covering selected regions in 10 African countries
### Objectives 
The primary objective of this analysis is to provide insights into healthcare accessibility, funding distribution, and efficiency across urban and rural areas.
### Data Cleaning and Preparation
The dataset was downloaded from Google Drive and imported into Power Query for preprocessing. The following steps were taken:
#### •	Duplicate Removal: Identified and removed duplicate rows.
#### •	Data Type Correction: Ensured all columns had appropriate data types.
#### •	Spelling Consistency Check: Reviewed column values for inconsistencies in spelling.
#### •	Null Value Handling: Checked and handled missing values appropriately.
#### A calculated column was created to classify regions as urban or rural based on population size and infrastructure availability:
#### •	Urban: Population ≥ 5000 AND at least one of electricity or internet availability is "Yes."
#### •	Rural: Population < 5000 AND lacks both electricity and internet availability.
#### •	Explicit Measures Created: To enhance analytical capabilities, explicit measures were developed to calculate:
##### •	Total Beds
##### •	Total Doctors
##### •	Total Nurses
##### •	Average Distance to Facility
##### •	Facility Count
##### •	Total Funding Received
##### •	Average Satisfaction Rate
##### •	Minimum Satisfaction Rate
##### •	Maximum Satisfaction Rate
##### •	Total Population

### Key Research Questions 
The analysis aims to answer the following research questions:
##### 1.	How does the distribution of healthcare facilities compare between rural and urban regions?
##### 2.	Are rural healthcare facilities receiving more funding than urban ones?
##### 3.	Are healthcare facilities with higher funding more likely to have shorter emergency response times?
##### 4.	Which facility types (hospitals, clinics, health centers) show the highest efficiency in terms of funding per patient visit?
##### 5.	What are the critical factors preventing equal access to healthcare across different regions?
##### 6.	What policy recommendations can be made to bridge the gap between urban and rural healthcare services?
##### 7.	How can governments optimize healthcare funding allocation to maximize impact in underserved regions?
### Key Insights

#### •	Funding per Patient Visit: Health centers had the highest efficiency ($10.17 per patient), followed by clinics ($10.06 per patient), and hospitals have the lowest efficiency ($10.05 per patient).
#### •	Healthcare Workforce: Across all regions, the number of nurses exceeds the number of doctors.
#### •	Facility: A total of 2000 Facilities were available in this dataset.
#### •	Distance to Facility: An average distance of 10.57KM was revealed.
#### •	Response Time: An average response time of 32.4 minutes was reaved across all facility types and locations.
#### •	Facility Distribution by Location: Rural areas have more healthcare facilities (1207) compared to urban areas (793).
#### •	Distance to Facility by Location: Rural areas have longer average distances to healthcare facilities (10.66KM) compared to urban areas (10.45KM).
#### •	Regional Distance to Facilities:
##### o	Shortest: The top 3 shortest distance to the facilities by region was recorded to be from Eastern Ethiopia (10.36KM), Northern Ghana (10.37KM), and Western Kenya (10.40KM) 
##### o	Longest: Eastern Nigeria (10.95KM) and Central Malawi (10.95KM) had the highest distance to the facilities.
#### •	Response Time by Facility Type: Clinics have the shortest emergency response time (32.1 minutes), followed by hospitals (32.49 minutes), while health centers have the longest response time (32.67 minutes).
#### •	Response Time by Location:
o	Urban facilities respond faster (32.31 minutes) compared to rural facilities (32.48 minutes).
#### •	Resource Allocation:
##### o	Clinics have more resources (beds, doctors, and nurses) than health centers and hospitals.
##### o	Rural locations have more healthcare resources than urban locations.
### Recommendations:
##### 1.	Improve Accessibility in Rural Areas
##### o	Since rural areas have longer distances to healthcare facilities, investment in mobile clinics and telemedicine services can help bridge the gap.
##### o	Governments should prioritize building new facilities in remote areas with poor access to healthcare.
#### 2.	Optimize Funding Allocation
##### o	Although rural facilities receive more funding, funding efficiency must be improved. A performance-based funding model should be implemented to ensure that funds are used effectively.
##### o	More transparency and monitoring should be introduced to track how healthcare funds are utilized.
#### 3.	Enhance Emergency Response Infrastructure
##### o	Rural areas have longer emergency response times; thus, investment in ambulance services, emergency care units, and training first responders will improve healthcare outcomes.
##### o	Governments and NGOs should explore drone technology for delivering emergency medical supplies in remote areas.
#### 4.	Strengthen Healthcare Workforce Distribution
##### o	Policies should incentivize healthcare professionals to work in rural areas by offering:
###### 	Higher salaries
###### 	Better living conditions
###### 	Career development opportunities
##### o	Community-based training programs can help increase the number of healthcare workers in underserved regions.
#### 5.	Improve Facility Efficiency
##### o	Health centers demonstrate higher efficiency per patient than hospitals and clinics. The government should:
###### 	Study and replicate best practices from the most efficient facilities.
###### 	Increase staffing and resource allocation to the most overburdened facilities.
#### 6.	Encourage Public-Private Partnerships
##### o	Collaboration between governments, NGOs, and private sector organizations can help improve healthcare infrastructure and service delivery.
##### o	Public-private initiatives can support low-cost insurance programs and subsidized healthcare services.
#### 7.	Implement Digital Health Solutions
##### o	Expanding internet connectivity in rural healthcare facilities will enhance telemedicine services and allow real-time patient data tracking.
##### o	Implementing electronic medical records (EMR) can improve healthcare management and efficiency.
#### 8.	Increase Community Engagement
##### o	Public health campaigns and community education programs can help raise awareness about available healthcare services.
##### o	Governments should invest in preventive healthcare by promoting sanitation, vaccination programs, and maternal healthcare.

##### These recommendations, if implemented, will significantly enhance healthcare accessibility, funding efficiency, and overall service delivery in Africa. 


### Limitations
#### Despite providing valuable insights, the analysis has some limitations:
#### 1.	Data Scope and Representation – The dataset covers only 10 African countries, which may not fully represent the healthcare challenges across the entire continent. A more extensive dataset would provide a broader perspective.
#### 2.	Static Data – The analysis is based on a static dataset, meaning real-time changes in healthcare infrastructure, funding, and workforce distribution are not reflected.
#### 3.	Lack of Patient Outcome Data – The dataset does not include health outcomes (e.g., mortality rates, disease prevalence), which limits the ability to assess healthcare effectiveness beyond funding and infrastructure.
#### 4.	Limited Granularity in Rural-Urban Classification – The classification of urban vs. rural areas is based only on population size and infrastructure availability. Other socio-economic factors like income levels and employment types could improve classification accuracy.
#### 5.	No Cost-Benefit Analysis – While funding efficiency is examined, the analysis does not include a cost-benefit breakdown to evaluate how funds are utilized in different facility types.
#### 6.	Response Time Analysis Assumptions – The emergency response times are averaged across facility types and locations, which may not account for specific delays due to traffic, terrain, or resource constraints.
### Future Enhancements
#### To improve the analysis, the following enhancements can be implemented:
#### 1.	Expand Dataset Coverage – Integrating data from more African countries and regions will provide a more comprehensive analysis of healthcare accessibility.
#### 2.	Incorporate Real-Time Data – Connecting Power BI to live data sources (e.g., government health agencies, WHO databases) will allow continuous monitoring of healthcare accessibility.
#### 3.	Include Patient Health Outcomes – Adding data on patient recovery rates, disease prevalence, and mortality can enhance insights into healthcare system effectiveness.
#### 4.	Refine Rural-Urban Classification – Incorporating additional variables such as median income, transportation access, and employment types can improve rural-urban classification accuracy.
#### 5.	Analyze Seasonal Trends – Examining how healthcare access changes across different seasons (e.g., rainy vs. dry seasons) can help in planning resource distribution.
#### 6.	Conduct Cost-Benefit Analysis – Assessing how funding is utilized at different facilities can provide insights into optimizing budget allocations.
#### 7.	Improve Emergency Response Analysis – Factoring in road conditions, geographical barriers, and facility-level response protocols will provide a more accurate picture of response time challenges.


### Conclusion 
#### This healthcare dashboard provides actionable insights into healthcare accessibility, funding distribution, and resource efficiency. The findings suggest that while rural areas have more healthcare facilities and receive higher funding, they also face challenges such as longer distances to facilities and slower emergency response times. These insights can help policymakers and stakeholders optimize healthcare investments and improve healthcare delivery in underserved regions.
